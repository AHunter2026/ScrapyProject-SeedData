{"Name": "Deep Purple Onion Seed", "Scientific_name": "Allium fistulosum", "Days_to_maturity": "60 days", "Life_cycle": "Annual", "Disease_resistance": null, "Hybrid_status": "Open Pollinated", "image_urls": ["https://www.johnnyseeds.com/on/demandware.static/-/Sites-jss-master/default/dwb8f8a6b3/products/germintation_guides/onions.jpg"], "Notes": "Seed can be sown in early spring for summer use, and in July or August for fall and spring use. Bunching onions prefer a soil with a pH of 6.2–6.8. Extra-hardy varieties will normally survive the winter if the soil is well drained."},
{"Name": "San Marzano II Organic Tomato Seed", "Scientific_name": "Solanum lycopersicum", "Days_to_maturity": "78 days", "Life_cycle": "Annual", "Disease_resistance": null, "Hybrid_status": "Open Pollinated", "image_urls": ["https://www.johnnyseeds.com/on/demandware.static/-/Sites-jss-master/default/dwdcbb3117/products/germintation_guides/tomatoes.jpg"], "Notes": "Medium-rich soil with pH 6.0–6.8 preferred. Fertilize accurately since excess nitrogen causes rampant growth, rot, and delayed ripening. For short determinates, succession-plant every 4–6 weeks. Tomatoes typically germinate in 5–7 days."},
{"Name": "Milagro Organic Lettuce Seed", "Scientific_name": "Lactuca sativa", "Days_to_maturity": "54 days", "Life_cycle": "Annual", "Disease_resistance": "Downy Mildew", "Hybrid_status": "Open Pollinated", "image_urls": ["https://www.johnnyseeds.com/on/demandware.static/-/Sites-jss-master/default/dw62133de0/products/germintation_guides/lettuce.jpg"], "Notes": "Lettuce is a hardy, cool-weather crop and can be planted with your earliest worked soil. It grows best at 60–65°F (16–18°C) and germinates best below 70°F (21°C), so careful variety selection is key for success in hotter weather."},
{"Name": "Curlesi Organic Endive Seed", "Scientific_name": "Cichorium endivia", "Days_to_maturity": "52 days", "Life_cycle": "Annual", "Disease_resistance": null, "Hybrid_status": "Open Pollinated", "image_urls": ["https://www.johnnyseeds.com/on/demandware.static/-/Sites-jss-master/default/dwd3b7b108/products/germintation_guides/radicchio.jpg"], "Notes": "Endive and escarole are hardy and can be planted as early as the soil can be worked. They are cool-weather crops and grow best at temperatures of 60–65°F (15.5–18.3°C). Careful variety selection is important for hot-weather plantings. For baby-leaf production, see the Baby Leaf Chicory culture."},

Consistent, adequate irrigation is needed to produce an abundant crop. Cucumbers are very sensitive to cold. Make sure both soil and air temperatures have warmed prior to planting. Using plastic mulch and row covers will greatly enhance the vigor and potential yields of cucumbers by providing warmth and insect protection. For greenhouse or high tunnel production the use of parthenocarpic varieties is highly recommended."},

Radishes are adversely affected by hot, dry weather. They remain in prime condition only a few days and should be grown rapidly with plenty of moisture to be mild, tender, and attractive. If growth is checked, roots may become tough, pithy, and too spicy."},

For spring and early summer transplanted crops, be sure to wait until the last frost date to transplant or direct seed the crop. Young plants may bolt to seed prematurely if they are exposed to frost or over a week of sub 50°F (10°C) nights."},
